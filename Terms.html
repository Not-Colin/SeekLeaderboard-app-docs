    <h1>Terms of Service for SeekLeaderBoard Generator</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 27th of May 2025</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms," "Terms of Service") carefully before using the SeekLeaderBoard Generator desktop application (the "Service," "App") operated by Not_Colin ("us," "we," or "our").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users who access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>SeekLeaderBoard Generator is a desktop application designed to fetch data from a Google Spreadsheet specified by you and generate a PNG image leaderboard. You are responsible for providing a valid Google Spreadsheet ID/URL and, optionally, a Discord Webhook URL for uploading the generated image.</p>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that interrupts, damages, or impairs the service.</p>

    <h2>2. Google Account Authentication</h2>
    <p>To access Google Sheets data, the App requires you to authenticate with your Google Account using OAuth 2.0. This process is handled by Google, and your Google credentials are not shared with the App. The App stores authentication tokens locally on your device as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The accuracy and content of the data in your Google Spreadsheets.</li>
        <li>Configuring the correct Google Spreadsheet ID/URL.</li>
        <li>Configuring a valid Discord Webhook URL if you choose to use the upload feature. You are responsible for the content uploaded to your specified webhook.</li>
        <li>Maintaining the security of your Google Account and the local files (<code>user_token.json</code>, <code>config.ini</code>) created by the App on your computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service and its original content (excluding data from your Google Sheets or user-generated images), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Not_Colin and its licensors. The stock images (wood texture, parchment, pin) used within the generated leaderboard are subject to their respective licenses, and you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to use them if you modify the application's assets.</p>
    <p><em>(Note: If you used stock assets, ensure you have the appropriate license to distribute them with your app or instruct users on how to obtain them. For personal use with friends, this is often less of a concern, but good to be aware of.)</em></p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
    <p>Not_Colin does not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Not_Colin, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service (e.g., data from your spreadsheet or content on Discord); (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
